Homo-Sapiens are violent creatures.  We are Human Animals first; Human Beings second.  The Human Being is a learned trait which is usually dictated by the culture or individual societal order.  It is the Human Being that outlines what is acceptable behavior in the society as a whole.  This is then codified by laws, complete with cause of action and consequence.  However, it matters not how pleasant a person behaves, basic need and want will drive the individual to our animalistic tenancies.

The reality of everyday life has not changed throughout generations.  There are people who feel they need or simply want, and will choose violence to obtain it.  The intent remains the same, only the environment changes.  This forces us to adopt a realistic Defensive Posture to change and adapt to the environment.  The Defensive Posture is a Lifestyle that is innately inherent to living and breathing.  We are alive and all living things are driven to stay alive.  This means it is unnatural for us to not want to preserve our life and ensure its growth and longevity.  It is also unnatural for us to not defend ourselves with any means necessary.   A Defensive Posture is not as simple as purchasing the defensive tool, the sidearm, shotgun or semi-automatic rifle.  The Defensive Posture begins with lifestyle choices. 

The mind and body are powered by food, sleep and exercise.  In order to successfully defend against an aggressive act, physical and mental fitness should be the top priority.  Mental preparation on a consistent basis is very important.   Fear causes emotional duress on the body and mind, dictating most actions and reactions.  It does not matter who you are, there is no absolute control of fear.  With this understanding, the cognitive process should incorporate the “What If’s” that could occur from situation to situation.  It is these contingencies that help to lessen the mental stumbling blocks that happen under emotional duress.

A physical understanding is an important piece to the Defensive Posture.   One must be physically active and healthy.  Every defensive encounter has a high risk of physical violence.  We may not always be as strong or fast as the Threat, but a true Defensive Posture means we are able to physically handle our own bodies during a potential assault.  The firearm plays a large role in this, but it does not negate the need for physical fitness.  If anything, it stresses the importance of consistent physical movement in a Defensive Engagement.

Every human has the inalienable Right to Life and the defense of oneself and loved ones is the highest priority.  It is a Consistent, Efficient and Safe Defensive Posture that preserves the Right to Life.  We train for that one moment that we all hope never comes, but may come all the same.
