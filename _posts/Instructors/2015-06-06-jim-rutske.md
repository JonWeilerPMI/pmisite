...twenty years of active duty experience. Deploying to every major conflict since Desert Storm he has accumulated a depth of tactical field experience and combat capability from dismounted team maneuvers to armored route clearance patrols. His final combat deployment was to Baghdad in 2007-2008 under the Army’s Task Force Troy Counter-Improvised Explosive Device unit where his actions on the battlefield earned him the Army Bronze Star. 

During his career Jim was an EOD Master Instructor for six of his twenty years specializing in small unit weapons and tactics, demolition, and nuclear ordnance. He authored the original Air Force M82A1 .50BMG and M14 SMUD 7.62 ordnance disruption certification course, giving his joint service career field the ability to disrupt ordnance and render safe terrorist devices from extreme distances. Jim has deep tactical field experience with numerous military weapon platforms from the M2 .50 BMG to the M4 5.56. His final assignment was to the Air Force’s Nuclear Weapons Center as the lead military manager for the joint service EOD career field in all matters relating to U.S. and foreign nuclear ordnance. In 2010 he retired and settled with his family in Albuquerque NM.

His spirited nature and passion for firearms led Jim to immerse himself into competitive shooting following his military retirement. Jim has experimented with multiple disciplines and events, but has found his calling in the sport of 3-gun. He travels the country to a variety of challenging 3-gun matches using pistol, rifle, and shotgun to clear exciting and often very physical stages. He has earned numerous industry sponsorships in the 3-Gun Tactical and Open Divisions and is training towards entering the Open Semi Pro Division in 2015 and Open Pro Division in 2016.

Jim joined the Professional Marksmen team in the spring of 2013 as a Defensive Academy Assistant Instructor. In 2014 he has since progressed into the responsibility of Lead Instructor for the Practical Pistol and Practical Carbine courses and Assistant Instructor for the Precision Academy. Starting in the spring of 2015 Jim will assume the role of Chief of Operations for Professional Marksmen and Whittington University Coordinator.
