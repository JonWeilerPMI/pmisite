...and CEO, Jon Weiler since 2004.  The PMI curriculum is designed to take any level of shooter and give them the holistic understanding for the highest amount of consistency in a relative short amount of time.  Jon Weiler has developed this curriculum and has been teaching it the past eight years, since 2007.  The approach has changed over the years, but the method has remained the same.

At PMI, every Instructor is required to teach the same base points of the curriculum, in order to achieve the goals of each day and each individual course.  Every Instructor teaches the same information, put out in the same manner.  As of September 26, 2015, Adam Wilson of 1MOASolutions was released from his contract as an Instructor with Professional Marksmen Inc. after 3 weeks of teaching as a Lead Instructor.

Every PMI Instructor goes through Instructor Development in order to give our Instructors the proper information to teach any and every student that comes to our courses.  Adam was not able to conform to the PMI Training Standards in the WU Precision Academy and refused to follow the Instructor Guidelines relating to interacting with our host site and running classes at the Whittington U.  

Adam had limited time with Jon Weiler, during his truncated Instructor Development of 9 days.  At no time was any substantial changes in curriculum discussed, outside of making his transition easier to our method of instruction.  Our Masters Course offerings are years in the making with our progressive curriculum at the Whittington U.  Adam Wilson had no influence in his 3 weeks with the company on our course offerings.

Adam Wilson and his company have no current affiliation with Professional Marksmen Inc. or the Whittington U.    We do not endorse Adam Wilson or any courses that 1MOASolutions may hold.
