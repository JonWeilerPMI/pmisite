What our instructors also see is how sometimes the handgun does not properly fit the shooter. A firearm too big or too small creates an improper fit and can result in poor recoil management and overall reduced control of the firearm. The end result of a poor fitting handgun is it result in severely diminished accuracy. The consequences of a poor fit in a life defending moment can be massive. Our Whittington U instructors are trained to look for these issues and will guide the student on how to best correct it. 

##The three most common issues we see resulting in a poor fit are as follows: 

###First (and most typical): 

The handgun grip itself. It is usually far too large or small for the shooters hand size. A proper sized grip is crucial to obtain secure control of the handgun and properly manage the recoil during the firing process. Many newer handguns come with interchangeable back straps that will allow the owner to adjust the overall size of the grip. However, many handguns do not have this option and the shooter is having to manage a grip that might not perfectly fit their hands. A shooter may want to consider shooting narrower single stack handguns as compared to double stack. A single stack grip is considerably slimmer than the higher capacity double stack.

###Second: 

The magazine release is too far forward from the thumb and the strong hand grip must be broken to in order to change the magazine. There may always be some rotation of the strong hand during a magazine change but what we are talking about here is a severe nearly 90 degree rotation. Our instructors have even noticed when the support hand will come up and help rotate the handgun so the thumb can reach the release button. This makes for a slower reload when every second may be life changing. Ask yourself can you successfully release the magazine without compromising your grip?

###Third: 

The slide cannot be successfully locked back to the rear, or released forward from the locked back position. During the Whittington U defensive shooting drills the student will lock back and release the slide a number of times. This is done during initial loading, magazine changes, and final clearing over the handgun when the drill is complete. It is imperative to be able to safely manipulate the slide on a handgun by yourself each and every time.

Our recommendations are nearly the same for every student to help alleviate the above three issues.  The bottom line is to find a handgun that fits your hands comfortably. You must also be able to reach and operate all the controls of the handgun. Don’t be lead into purchasing a firearm based on color, name brand, aesthetics, or simply because the salesmen says this is a perfect gun for you. Handle the cleared firearm and dry fire it, change an empty magazine, and make sure you can successfully lock the slide to the rear, and release it forward. Do this a number of times and compare it with your other handgun choices. Keep in mind that most new in the box handguns with interchangeable grips will be shown with the most common used middle size grip extension. So there may be a smaller or larger grip available that would fit your hands better.

Another final consideration is the take-down of the handgun for cleaning. I have seen more than a couple of students who are experiencing functioning or reliability issue with the handgun only to discover the gun has never been properly cleaned or oiled. Why? Most often the answer is because they don’t know how to disassemble the handgun or it is too difficult to take apart. Ensure that when you are purchasing a firearm you have the seller show you how to disassemble and reassemble that handgun. If you are trying to choose between two handguns, the ease of disassembly could be a big factor in your final decision. 

The bottom line is to find a handgun that fits you. It must be comfortable in your hands and fully functional in your defensive lifestyle.
