I am often tasked on the defensive range to evaluate a shooters target and grouping. By looking at the target paper we can learn quite a bit about how the student is interacting with the firearm. Do they have a firm grip, are they misaligning the sights, are they anticipating the recoil, or are they overlooking one of the most important fundamentals…the trigger pull. 

I was on the range this last weekend with a friend who had fired a handgun only a few times before. He asked if I could help him learn the proper way to shoot as he had near zero experience. It sounded like a great way to spend some time with a longtime friend. He listened and learned very quickly but he was having difficulty getting the accuracy he thought he should have. I watched his body mechanics, physical interaction with the firearm and the target paper results. I made adjustments and gave advice and the groups were getting tighter but still not to his goal. I then took a look at just his trigger finger and discovered where he was causing instability. He was literally crushing the trigger back as hard and fast as he could at the moment he wanted the gun to go off. 

I started with an effective technique called the two second trigger. From the start of the trigger pull to the end of the movement should be done in a steady, constant movement that lasts an unhurried two seconds and ends with momentarily holding the trigger to the rear and then returning it to the start in another two second pace. I made him say out loud as the trigger was moving in each direction “one one-thousand, two one-thousand”. This slowed his trigger finger down creating a “speed limit” and resulted in a steady and even movement. The firearm will naturally fire somewhere along the path and it should come as a surprise. The slower deliberate trigger pulled made a dramatic difference in his grouping. He shot a number of rounds this way before slowly picking up the pace of his pull while still maintaining the accuracy. 

The next piece of the accuracy puzzle we worked on was isolation of the trigger finger with a steady grip. I noticed when he picked up the pace of his trigger pull his hands would squeeze just before the moment the gun would fire. Ideally your grip should maintain a steady consistent pressure and the only thing that moves is your trigger finger. A great way to practice this is with dry firing. Dry firing eliminates the human reaction to flinch from recoil and allows you to focus on the mechanics. With a clear and safe gun try have your trigger finger be the only movement in the dry fire pull. By isolating the trigger finger it keeps the rest of the hand from influencing the muzzle of the handgun while dry firing or live firing.
 
It was amazing to see the distinct results from a few pieces of advice coupled with straight forward static firing drills. My friend was hooked and I have no doubt I will be getting the phone call soon about his new handgun purchase. It is easy to take the trigger pull for granted as it seems so mechanically simple. Yet without a doubt it has a massive impact in accuracy. Next time you are on the range or running dry fire drills pay special attention to your trigger pull and see what it is doing to your groups. See you on the range.
