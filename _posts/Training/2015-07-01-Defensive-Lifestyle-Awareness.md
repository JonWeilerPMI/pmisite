This article is taken from an actual event:  (http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/57051605-story) 

> “Give me your money or I’ll kill you.”

This is the words heard by a man named Fernando Torres from Cornelius, NC, while pumping gas on his way home from work.

> “He put a gun in my stomach and said give me your money or I’ll kill you. Then he hit me in the face and the stomach," said Torres.

I travel everywhere and find myself complacent on many occasions, especially while pumping gas.  Our routines become comfortable, they take us away from the potentials around us.  In this case, Torress was going home after a day of work, looking forward to seeing his family when he assaulted. He was not anticipating this, it just happened.  The article does not give an account of whether Torres was armed or not, but what if he were?  Would this have changed any outcome?  

That is difficult to answer.  An armed citizen is supposed to be vigilant, however this is not always the case.  Again, I find myself in various stages of complacency - as we all do.  The questions is:  Would the firearm integrated into his everyday life changed the outcome of this?  

I believe it would.

##Readiness Preparation

We live in a world now that seems to be constantly under threat, whether it from crime, regulation or even terrorism.  To carry a firearm concealed is a very responsible action now, as long as we are prepared to truly integrate it into our lives.  This means forethought and training.   

###We have to ask ourselves:

1.	Can you carry legally?  
	a.	If your state requires a Concealed Carry Permit, you must obtain one.
	
2.	Which type firearm will you carry?

3.	What caliber?

4.	How will carry your firearm?

5.	Does anything in your day prohibit your concealed carry?

6.	Are you confident with your firearm - how often do you train with it?

These questions are among others, but are at the core of integrating the firearm tool into everyday life.  When we decide to take this step, we assume a large amount of Obligation and Responsibility.  Violence is the means of Last Resort, where there is nowhere left to go except the potential for deadly force.  

The final question is:  How are you preparing for this?

## Environmental Posturing

There are many factors that affect our society:  economy, politics, war and “terrorism” to name a few.  All of these items are chaotic in nature and do not ultimately promote peace within a nation, regardless of the side it is on.  This chaos filters down to the individual, who for whatever reason will make a decision to take by any means necessary.  And that individual could want money, drugs, cars or even people.  Human beings are capable of terrible acts and it is up to us to take the steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  Property is expendable, people are not. 
   
>"I thought about my children, my family. Because I am the only one providing for them," said Torres.

That quote, taken from the article, is an interesting thought process.  In our courses, we routinely discuss the Defensive Lifestyle and the common response is “Let it happen to me.”  Most people will default to this without really taking into consideration how important they are to loved ones.  We always want to protect them by shielding them from violence, but we also fill a large role in their lives.  There would be a great void left if you were no longer in it.  We want to keep our children, husbands and wives safe and happy but this is impossible if we are no longer alive.

This leads back to Situational Awareness and Environmental Posturing:  

	*Where does our day take us and how and when are we likely to encounter others?  

	*Is our city/town/area seeing a large economic downturn and if so, how is that affecting truancy and crime in the area?  

	*What is the likelihood of violent interaction with others?  

Situational Awareness is immediate, with those moving about you.  Environmental Posturing is being aware of the potential for threats based on the external affects in a regional location.  This should mean our neighborhood, our routes to and from our homes and at our place of business/shopping/learning/etc.…

This does not mean that bad things do not happen in relatively “stable” areas either; the factors discussed above just become an indicator to understand the social dynamics and what affects them.  The article states that police had not seen robberies like this over the past year in Torres's area.  It was not common  or even expected, and yet it happened to this man on his way home from work. 

##The Firearm Tool

I began by stating that the firearm could have prevented this from happening.  This does not mean a violent outcome, in fact it means the opposite of that.  When we integrate the firearm tool into our everyday lives, our perspective and perceptions change.  We project an air of awareness, which becomes a strong deterrent to potential attacks.  It will not prevent everything but it will give us a higher potential for survivability and that is the overall goal.  If we can stop an aggressive action before it happens by being alert and aware in our environment, violence does not have to happen and that is a good thing.  If violence does have to happen, if we are forced to respond, we are then prepared and capable of *Defending* ourselves if that need arises.  

The firearm tool, integrated into our everyday lives, helps to enhance our Situational Awareness and Environmental Posturing.  The two go hand in hand and when we utilize the available means of defense, we begin to scrutinize our environment.  

Paranoia should never be a word used in this process.  Vigilance and Confidence is the true description.
