The Noveske Multigun Championship 2015 was held at the Colorado Rifle Club in Byers Colorado over the 29th & 30th of August weekend. This was my second time at this particular match, the first being in 2013. Mark Passamaneck was the Range Master for this match and he is also the owner of Carbon Arms Corp. Mark ran a very smooth and orderly match and was always checking in to the stage range officials and shaking hands with the competitors.

The match consisted of 10 well designed yet very fun stages. 7 of the stages were completed on Saturday with the remaining 3 Sunday morning. I always appreciate matches that front load the stages. It allows for an earlier finish on the final day permitting for easier travel home. All of the stage descriptions were prior posted on the match’s Facebook page allowing for overview and strategy long prior to the match. Stage descriptions are always taken with an understanding that what you see in the stage description two months earlier might not be identical to what you see in the final stage design. Nonetheless the stages were executed well and everything ran smoothly from the competitor’s point of view.

I was lucky enough to be squaded with some great shooters. The squad ranged from brand new shooters to the pro competitors. This is often the case with any 3-gun match and it adds to the fun of it all. The one thing that is always in common though is the love of the sport. I often hear from new competitors that they were surprised everyone was so helpful and friendly. Everyone strives to make sure everybody is having a fun and safe time. Advice and helpful tips flow like water as we share thoughts and perspective and even often share the gear we brought along. I know I have borrowed out almost every piece of gear I own at one time or another. It is all for the love of the game. 
The prize table was very well populated with some amazing prizes. The competitors pick a prize of their own choice and get called in the order of finishing place, but everyone walked away with a great prize this year. The match directors garnered some great industry donations from nearly all the major companies. I didn’t get to attend last year’s match but it has certainly grown from 2013. I know I’m looking forward to next year.

If you have ever thought about but never attended a multigun or 3-gun match I highly encourage you to do so. The gear you need is probably the gear you already have. Start with a local match at your nearby range to see, and experience what it is all about. You do not need to drop tons of money on gear to compete, just show up with what you have, and have a good time. See you on the range!
