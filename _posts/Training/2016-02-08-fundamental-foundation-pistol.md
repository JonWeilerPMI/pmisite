Since our courses began in 2012 at the Whittington U, we have focused around a three position presentation technique around a High Ready Retention of the firearm.  The majority of students who have come through our classes are new to the High Ready, but walk away from the class a more Consistent, Efficient and Safe shooter.

# Consistent, Efficient and Safe: Fundamental Foundation

Our Defensive Academy revolves around utilizing the firearm as a Defensive Tool.  The drills are designed to maximize efficiency of movement, allowing the body to act while the mind is reacting/assessing the situation.  This is very important when contemplating an engagement that can result in Life or Death.  Emotions are a tricky thing; the main event that is occurring is a reaction to Fear.  It does not matter who we are, Fear will play a role in the response to a potential deadly threat.  Fear can speed things up and Fear can slow things down, sometimes to a standstill.  It is important to acknowledge that this is possible within us and that Fear will always be with us, no matter what happens.  

## Foundation #1:  Consistency

We want the body to act in a defensibly sound fashion, giving the mind adequate time for the appropriate response to the situation.  Consistency is the first step: doing the same things, the same way over and over again in a defensibly sound fashion.  This builds our muscle memory and gives our body a foundation of movement to fall back on.  This is what we practice during our dry fire drills from the comfort of our homes, employ in our static fire warm up and hone in our dynamic movement drills on the range.

We utilize a 3 position presentation technique to simplify the path of the muzzle and increase the efficiency of movement under periods of duress.  The first position is Rest, where the firearm is housed in the holster.  The second position is Ready, where the firearm contours the body and transitions to the High Ready position at chest level.  The third position is Engage, where the muzzle is oriented on the Threat, arms extended with joints locked, front/rear sights aligned and finger on the trigger.  

## Foundation #2: Efficiency

The Defensive Posture generally will revolve around a Concealed Carried Weapon of some sort, in this case we are focusing on the sidearm.  Whether the firearm is under clothing or not, it is concealed from sight from those around us.  This means that there are steps to be taken to expose and deploy the firearm.  We want these movements to be as simple and efficient as possible.  We do not need excessive movement that may affect the muzzle and we certainly do not want the firearm to be taken, to be used against us.  We contour the body as the firearm is deployed from the holster so we can feel the firearm at all times and do not need to look for the firearm.  We also keep firearm close to the body in the event that we have to fight for it, we want to ensure that we will have the leverage.

The proximity of the Threat will dictate the orientation of the muzzle, meaning to draw from the holster with an immanent Threat, the muzzle can be immediately trained on the Threat.  If we are unsure of the situation and choose to retain the firearm, the muzzle will remain in our circle of safety in the Ready Position.  Overall, the firearm will still follow the fundamental path created in our Consistency Foundation.  This path provides an efficiency of movement, while retaining leverage over the movement of the muzzle and of the firearm itself.

## Foundation #3: Safe

Safety is the highest priority when interacting with all firearms.  This is engrained in us from childhood, if we were fortunate enough to be raised around them.  If we choose to instill the firearm into our everyday life in a Defensive role, then we have to train.   There is no way around this, we all have to practice with our equipment.  We should never place a firearm on our body and interact with the public until we are comfortable and confident with it.  Safety cannot ever be taken for granted.

With that said, we still have to be safe if confronting a Threat.  We can be accosted at any time in any place.  There are more likely locations than others, but the reality is bad things happen anywhere.  We need to consider the Resolutions of a Threat:

1.	We leave the situation.

a.	If we have the ability to, we get out of there.  Remove yourself from the situation and call the police; remember as many details as possible of the encounter and individual(s).

2.	The Threat leaves the situation.

a.	This can happen for a number of reasons.  Our posture (awareness) can deter a potential violent encounter, people around us can help deter violence or even you feeling the need to make Ready with the firearm forces the Threat away.  Intervention or happenstance, these are challenging situations.

3.	We are forced to engage the Threat.

a.	Violence as the means of last resort, always.  The only time that it is necessary to engage a Threat is when harm or death is immanent, we as the individual feel this strongly enough to deploy our defensive tool and engage.  Once that firearm is deployed, it cannot go back again until the situation is resolved.  Whether it is through #2 or #3, it will be resolved. 
 
With that also, we cannot call back that projectile once it is fired.  Our training the body to act in a Defensibly Sound Manner (Consistency) should help ensure a consistent path for the muzzle, from the Rest, Ready and Engage Position.

Throughout these Resolutions of the Threat, we have to remain Safe.  We move through many different environments throughout our day, with and without people that we love.  Think about dropping our kids off at school or stopping by the grocery store after work. Now think about the other people moving around us with the same things going on in their lives, just going to work, the store or home.  Nobody wants to be assaulted, at any time or any place.  

When violent encounters occur, our first thoughts are: “What is happening?” and “Why is this happening?”  All in a span of time that is requiring us to physically react to a physical assault.
