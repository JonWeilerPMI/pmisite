# PMI Defensive Courses:  Train for Everyday

PMI’s goal is the integration of the firearm tool into everyday life.  The PMI Defensive Courses revolve around the Defensive Implementation of the Pistol, Shotgun and Semi-Automatic Rifle Platforms.   Every PMI Defensive Course is open to all ages, genders and experience levels.  A Consistent-Efficient-Safe interaction with the firearm tool is the goal in each Defensive Course, regardless of the firearm platform.  Each course curriculum is designed around how we live our lives and the integration of the defensive tool.
