...to a very diverse student base.  We focus on a Consistent, Efficient and Safe presentation of the muzzle in our Defensive Courses and Consistency = Accuracy as our formula for success in our Precision Rifle Courses.  

Our courses are designed around our Everyday Lives.  Our drills are structured to instill a strong holistic understanding of the firearm took, environment around us and ourselves.  All PMI Instructors are Combat Veterans who can speak from experience, although our courses are not aggressive in any shape or form.  We teach from a Violence as a Means of Last Resort in our Defensive Courses and from a very technical approach/data gathering in our Precision Rifle Courses.

All Professional Marksmen Inc. Lead Instructors are Teachers first; this means our goal is the retention of the information presented to every student.  We want you to leave our courses with a high level understanding of the material focus and how to train in between PMI Courses.

## Our Lives...

Our lives are filled with uncertainty but this does not mean they are filled with despair.  We cannot control Time; we can only control what we do with it.  We train for the worst case situations but live our lives the best way we can.  The PMI Method will help you in an understanding of this.  We focus on a holstic approach to ourselves.  We first must understand ourselves, our capabilities and our limitations.  The become our perameters.  Anyone is capable of anything; it only a matter of belief.  

We want to help you be the best person that you can be.
