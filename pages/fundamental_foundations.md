##PMIâ€™s Defensive Discipline Fundamental Foundation Courses:

Our Fundamental Foundations are preparatory courses leading into the Defensive Discipline Courses. The purpose of the Fundamental Foundation Courses is to provide students who have very little interaction with firearms or are renting a PMI firearm for the class.

Fundamental Foundations delivers a base of confidence in the understanding and safe handling of your firearm prior to entering a Defensive Discipline Course. If you are a new to firearms and would like a trained professional take you through the basics, this course is for you.


#PMI Fundamental Foundation: Pistol

Fundamental Foundation: Pistol covers the different types of pistol operation, from the semi-automatic and revolver platforms, loading/unloading, safe handing and maintenance. This six hour course will instill an effective base of understanding of the semi-automatic and revolver pistol platforms.

*This course is highly recommended for new firearm owners and is a great segway into the [PMI Defensive Pistol Series.][1]*
