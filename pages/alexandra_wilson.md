Despite her inexperience she enjoyed the challenges competing presented and quickly excelled in the sport.

By her sophomore year, Alexandra was selected as the team captain, and won the NRA Intercollegiate Women’s Sport Pistol National Championships a year later.  With that win, she earned a spot on the USA Shooting team.  She trained and competed for USAS for two years, even moving to Colorado to utilize the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.  After a successful college career, Alexandra started competing in every match she could get to, including NRA Action Pistol, USPSA, IDPA and 3-Gun. Alexandra has been an NRA certified instructor since 2007, and is a former shooting instructor for the Missouri Department of Conservation.
