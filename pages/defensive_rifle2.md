[Our Defensive Rifle 2][1] is a 3 day, Intermediate to Advanced level course that increases the challenge in the Individual Movement Drills/Principles of Cover/Alternate Firing Positions, while introducing Lowlight Engagements and Engaging in Motion Drills. 

The Defensive Rifle II Course gives students the opportunity to move 360 degrees safely, engage while in motion while utilizing the reactive steel targets and engage several hours into the evening during the Lowlight Engagements for two out of the three nights of instruction. 

Defensive Rifle II will expose you to an overall concept of a Defensive Lifestyle and how the semi-automatic rifle fits nicely within it.
